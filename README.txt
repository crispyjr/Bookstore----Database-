How to run code: 
I used Python and psycopg2. Make sure that psycopg2 is installed.
Install command for terminal: pip install psycopg2

In the file: LookInnaBook.py
Steps: 1. Run the program
       2. type 'commands' in terminal to get all the commands you can use

If you are running this on your end, make sure to change the password for the database.
Example: con = psycopg2.connect(
        host = "localhost",
        database = "Project",
        user = "postgres",
        password = "") <<-- Put your postgressql password here. Every function has it, so to easily change it, ctrl + f and replace the current password 'Meleshia14' to your password.
